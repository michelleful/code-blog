<p>I'm a PhD candidate in linguistics at MIT. I apply probabilistic, computational methods to investigate how morphology is learned, particularly non-concatenative morphology in Arabic and Hebrew.</p>

<p>I love to code, particularly on projects for language learners. As a keen student of languages myself, I have many ideas for how to improve educational technology for language learning. See the <a href="http://fuzzyarabic.herokuapp.com">Fuzzy Arabic Dictionary</a> for an example.</p>

<p>I mostly code in Python and JavaScript, and I've also explored functional programming with Scala and Haskell. I've an enthusiastic member of the Python community in Boston and further afield, attending, and sometimes speaking at, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/">Boston Python</a>, <a href="http://boston.pyladies.com/">PyLadies Boston</a>, <a href="/2014/05/08/lightning-talk-at-pycon-2014/">PyCon</a>, and <a href="http://pydata.org/nyc2014/abstracts/#300">PyData</a>. I help beginners with their projects at the PyLadies weekend meetup.</p>

<p>I'm currently in my final year at MIT and looking for a job in the Boston area as a software engineer or data scientist, preferably in work relating to language in some way, for example natural language processing or language learning. Contact me at michelle.fullwood@gmail.com if you'd like to talk.</p>
